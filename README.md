* **Real-Time Camera Feed**: Displays the robot’s camera feed, processed to detect the line and adjust its movement accordingly.
* **Data Logging**: Logs real-time sensor data and control outputs for analysis, including GPS, IMU, and wheel speed data.
* **Learning Capabilities**: Pre-trained machine learning models are used for control, enhancing the robot’s performance over time.
* **Simulation in Webots**: Operates in a **Webots** simulated environment, providing realistic testing of the robot’s navigation and control algorithms.

* **`line-follower.py`**: Implements the line-following logic and sets up the robot’s behavior in Webots.
* **`supervisor_controller.py`**: Supervisory control for managing robot interactions with the environment in Webots.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/2black0/Line-Follower-Computer-Vision-Webots.git
   cd Line-Follower-Computer-Vision-Webots
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r Project/controllers/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Webots Simulation**:

   * Open **Webots** and load the world files from the **worlds** directory.
   * Run the simulation with the appropriate controller for the robot.

## 🏃 Usage

1. **Run the robot control script**:

   * To use **PID** control:

   ```sh
   python Project/controllers/robot_controller.py
   ```

2. **Control Modes**:

   * You can switch between control modes for base speed and delta speed. The following control modes are available:

     * **PID**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control.
     * **Fuzzy**: Fuzzy logic control based on predefined fuzzy rules.
     * **Machine Learning**: Pre-trained models (e.g., **Decision Trees**, **Neural Networks**) for controlling the robot.

   You can modify the control modes by updating the variables in the script:

   ```python
   BaseControl = 'PID'  # PID, Fuzzy, DecisionTree, NeuralNetworks, etc.
   DeltaControl = 'PID'  # PID, Fuzzy, DecisionTree, NeuralNetworks, etc.
   ```

3. **Enable Data Logging**:

   * To log sensor data and control parameters, set the `Log` parameter to `True` during robot initialization.

   Example:

   ```python
   LineFollower = LineFollower(Log=True, Camera=True, Learning=False)
   ```

4. **Enable Camera Feed**:

   * To display the camera feed in real-time, set the `Camera` parameter to `True`.

5. **Video Recording**:

   * To save the camera feed as a video file, enable the video recording feature by setting the `CameraSaved` parameter to `True`.

   Example:

   ```python
   LineFollower.run(CameraSaved=True)
   ```

## 🤖 Controller Description

The **robot\_controller.py** script handles the control algorithms:

* **PID Control**: Used for adjusting the robot’s speed and position based on the angle and error.
* **Fuzzy Logic**: A fuzzy control system that uses fuzzy rules to adjust the robot’s base speed and delta speed.
* **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-trained models like Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Random Forests are used to predict base and delta speed based on sensor inputs.

### ⚙️ Fuzzy Control Rules

* **Angle Control**: Adjusts the base speed based on the robot’s angle relative to the line.
* **Error Control**: Uses fuzzy logic to adjust the robot's movement based on the sensor input and error correction.

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models

* The system uses pre-trained models for both base and delta speed control, improving the robot’s performance over time.

## 📊 Data Logging

The system logs various data (e.g., angle, speed, sensor data) during the simulation into a **CSV** file. This data can be used for analysis or further tuning of the control algorithms.

## 🔚 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of **PID control**, **Fuzzy Logic**, and **Machine Learning** to create an autonomous **line-following robot** in **Webots**. By experimenting with different control strategies, you can optimize the robot’s performance in different environments.
